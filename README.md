# News_Category_Classification

### The News_Category_Dataset.zip file contains news_train, news_test, news_val csv files derived from the parent news category dataset (in .txt format) downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset. The .txt parent dataset is larger than 25mb, so couldn't be uploaded to GitHub, hence provided the link.
# data_preparation.py:  ### This program does the above, reads the news_category.txt file and breaks it down into news train, test and val sets. This program performs data consistency checks and train test val splits. To run this program use this command: python data_preparation.py
